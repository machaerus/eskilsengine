# Eskil's Folly

This is an experimental game engine for visual novels. It was designed specifically to support development of our game, Eskil's Folly, which has never seen the light of day, yet isn't really *abandoned*. Maybe one day it will be finished.

The engine is designed to support both GUI and CLI at the same time, so that every game could be played in with or without graphics. For every scene and every action there are pure text descriptions supposed to be specified. This being said, the GUI is not currently implemented.

You can browse the code, if you want, but keep in mind that this is a work in progress which should not be expected to do anything interesting at the moment.
